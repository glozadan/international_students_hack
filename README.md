# international_students_hack
Elaborated for the Hackademy and Skills for Women in Tech Hackathon. 
As we are both Django Backend Padawans, the solution involves backend only.
>The problem chosen was 
1.- International institutions and organizations grant students to pursue degrees, master’s degrees and doctorates abroad but there is no follow-up of these students. How can we keep track of scholarship holders, their status? How can we communicate with them? How can we build community among them?

Our solution involves the creation of a web application that will keep records of the institutions that offer scholarships, the scholarships they offer and the students who enjoy such scholarships. 
In order to maintain contact and keep track of the students, we propose to keep a register of a social network, with which the institutions can create groups so that the students know each other. We also consider the registration of "Events", each student will be able to view the events of which it is part or is invited.
Each student will have to log in to view such events, and will have the responsibility of uploading a report reporting their current situation, from grades to difficulties of any kind, to track their case.
